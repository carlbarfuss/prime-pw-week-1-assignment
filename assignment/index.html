    <ul>
<li>I've lived in 3 different countries and 9 different states in the past 20 years</li>
<li>My favorite new thing to learn is words, particularly words from new languages, and my all time favorite word is Schadenfreude</li>
<li>When I was a child, my shoe size kept up with my age ane continued until I turned 15.  This caused all sorts of worry that I would turn into some sort of "clown monster".  I still have to special order my shoes but at least I don't have to get them from the clown store! </li>

<p> My favorite quote - “He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.” - Friedrich Nietzsche.  I feel that this quote really encapsulates the effect that our efforts and our environment have on us, both good and ill, and speaks to why we should be careful at the endeavors to which we strive, the company we keep, and the methods we employ.</p>
